									<span>I pray thee, cease thy counsel,</span>

									<span>As water in a sieve: give not me counsel;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Nor let no comforter delight mine ear</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Bring me a father that so lov’d his child,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Whose joy of her is overwhelm’d like mine,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And bid him speak of patience;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Measure his woe the length and breadth of mine,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And let it answer every strain for strain,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>As thus for thus and such a grief for such,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>In every lineament, branch, shape, and form:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>If such a one will smile, and stroke his beard,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Bid sorrow wag, cry “hem!” when he should groan,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Patch grief with proverbs; make misfortune drunk</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With candle-wasters; bring him yet to me,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And I of him will gather patience.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But there is no such man: for, brother, men</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Can counsel and speak comfort to that grief</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Which they themselves not feel; but, tasting it,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Their counsel turns to passion, which before</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Would give preceptial medicine to rage,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Fetter strong madness in a silken thread,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Charm ache with air and agony with words.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>No, no; ’tis all men’s office to speak patience</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To those that wring under the load of sorrow,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But no man’s virtue nor sufficiency</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To be so moral when he shall endure</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The like himself. Therefore give me no counsel;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>My griefs cry louder than advertisement.</span>
