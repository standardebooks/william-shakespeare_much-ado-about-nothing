									<span>Change slander to remorse; that is some good.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But not for that dream I on this strange course,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But on this travail look for greater birth.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>She dying, as it must be so maintain’d,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Upon the instant that she was accus’d,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Shall be lamented, pitied and excus’d</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of every hearer; for it so falls out</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That what we have we prize not to the worth</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Whiles we enjoy it, but being lack’d and lost,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Why, then we rack the value, then we find</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The virtue that possession would not show us</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Whiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>When he shall hear she died upon his words,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The idea of her life shall sweetly creep</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Into his study of imagination,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And every lovely organ of her life</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Shall come apparell’d in more precious habit,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>More moving, delicate, and full of life</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Into the eye and prospect of his soul,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Than when she liv’d indeed: then shall he mourn⁠—</span>
									<br/>
									<span>If ever love had interest in his liver⁠—</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And wish he had not so accused her,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>No, though he thought his accusation true.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Let this be so, and doubt not but success</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Will fashion the event in better shape</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Than I can lay it down in likelihood.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But if all aim but this be levell’d false,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The supposition of the lady’s death</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Will quench the wonder of her infamy:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And if it sort not well, you may conceal her⁠—</span>
									<br/>
									<span>As best befits her wounded reputation⁠—</span>
									<br/>
									<span>In some reclusive and religious life,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Out of all eyes, tongues, minds, and injuries.</span>
